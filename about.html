  <p>Notes@BTech is a student-driven initiative created by passionate scholars just like you, who understand the value of quality educational resources. We believe that knowledge should be freely accessible to everyone, and that's why we have dedicated ourselves to curating and distributing comprehensive notes for all subjects and courses offered at ABESIT.</p>
